currency: EURUSD
timeframe: 5m (300s)
started: 2026-06-01
target: best UP and DOWN binary predictor at 300s, OOS(2026)-verified, clearing breakeven 0.541
status: IN PROGRESS — instantiating SWEEP_MATRIX for 5m. Combined 5m books exist (m5xp oos 0.606, m5stack
        comb 0.613) but BOTH side-keys (5m,UP)/(5m,DOWN) are UNTESTED. 5m sits between the efficiency zone
        (60s/2m ~0.50-0.55) and the 15m edge (~0.58 robust / 0.647 recent); the 15m parent front-loads into 5m.
incumbent/answer: TBD (row 0 side-split pending). Combined incumbents: EURUSD.m5xp.v1 (oos26 0.606),
        EURUSD.m5stack.v1 (comb 0.613 / oos26 0.571).
prior: 5m direction combined ~0.61 verifiable, capped by the 15m parent; binding window 2025. UP side likely
        live (dip-buy, as at 60s/15m); DOWN side likely dead. >0.65 OOS-stable not expected at 5m.

# Sweep ledger — EURUSD 5-minute (300s) UP/DOWN

Each row: pre-register falsifier → retarget to 300s (`MX_HOR=5`) → deriv-faithful discipline (wc_ret/contig
ties-LOSE, nonoverlap_chrono 300s, per-year 2024/25/26 CI95, worst-VAL-half selection, moved-bars
up-rate∈[.47,.53] tripwire) → score combined + UP + DOWN → record into EURUSD_RESULTS.md → commit. `OOS`
columns = per-year 2024/2025/2026 moved-only accuracy.

Settlement note: the frozen 5m books (m5xp/m5stack) settle close-to-close over a wall-clock-CONTIGUOUS 300s
window (`contig=(secs[HOR:]-secs[:-HOR])==HOR*60`), label `_y=(fwd>0)`, tie bars (`fwd==0`) dropped at build
(immaterial at 5m: exact-zero 300s log-return is ~measure-zero). This IS the book's own settlement; the
side-split decomposes the book's measured combined number faithfully.

Breakeven 0.541 (R≈1.85). Binding constraint = WORST held-out year's moved-acc CI95-lower clearing 0.541.
